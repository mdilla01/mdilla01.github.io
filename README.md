DESCRIPTION:
	This project sought to create a personal portfolio using html and CSS. This portfolio may be used for internship or job opportunities as well as graduate school.

IMPLEMENTATION:
	This project utilized git throughout to save changes and push these changes to the associated GitHub account.

	The CSS file had over five rules, and contained both classes and ids. 

	All pages passed the HTML5 specifications, according to the W3C Validator.

	The CSS file passed the CSS validation.

	This project contains three HTML pages: index.html (the home page), resume.html (my resume), and bio.html (a brief biography describing both education and other activities). The file also contains one CSS file styles.css, which controls the design for all three html files.

	index.html is hosted in my Tufts CS account and redirects to the actual website on GitHub.

	Only HTML and CSS were used.
